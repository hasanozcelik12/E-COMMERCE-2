• React-router-dom, react-redux and react-thunk-middleware were used in this project. 
• First, components, pages and reducers were created. Then, the codes that needed to be known to create the home page were written in a component and sent to the reducer with the help of dispatch. 
• From this process, After completion, the information in the reducer was stored in the store, where it can be accessed and changed by all components of the application.
• The information registered in the store was accessed by the home page and the card structures on the home page were created.
• Whichever product you want to choose from on the home page is added to the cart by clicking the add to cart button.
